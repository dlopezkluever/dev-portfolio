## Project Overview

**Merlin's Grimoire: Chemistry Edition** is an innovative educational wizard game that transforms chemistry learning into an immersive magical adventure. Players traverse procedurally generated labyrinths as the wizard Merlin, collecting mythical ingredients to craft potions through real chemical reactions, then activate these potions into spells by solving chemistry problems to defeat mythical enemies and unlock treasure.

## The Vision

Traditional chemistry education often feels disconnected from real-world application and lacks the engagement needed to maintain student interest. Our game bridges this gap by integrating authentic chemistry problems directly into compelling gameplay mechanics, making complex chemical concepts feel natural and exciting to learn.
