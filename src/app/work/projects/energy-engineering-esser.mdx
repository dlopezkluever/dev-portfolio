## Overview

During my internship at Entegrity Energy Partners, I worked on Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) projects, conducting investment grade audits for school districts in Kansas and Missouri. This role combined engineering analysis with client communication and business strategy.

## Key Contributions

### Investment Grade Audits
- Conducted comprehensive energy audits of school facilities
- Analyzed HVAC systems, lighting, and building envelope efficiency
- Calculated ROI and payback periods for proposed energy improvements
- Created detailed reports meeting federal ESSER funding requirements

### Client Engagement
- Presented findings and recommendations in client meetings
- Explained complex energy optimization strategies in accessible terms
- Discussed project finances and installation schedules with stakeholders
- Built trust with school district administrators and facility managers

### Research & Analysis
- Authored a comprehensive report on Bipolar Ionization technology
- Analyzed effectiveness claims versus actual performance data
- Provided evidence-based recommendations to clients
- Contributed to company's knowledge base on emerging technologies

## Technical Skills Applied
- Energy modeling and simulation software
- Financial analysis and ROI calculations
- Technical report writing
- Data visualization for presentations
- Building systems analysis

## Impact

My work helped school districts secure federal funding for critical infrastructure improvements while reducing their long-term energy costs. The Bipolar Ionization report I authored became a reference document for the company's consulting team, helping clients make informed decisions about air quality technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Key Takeaway

This experience taught me how to bridge the gap between technical engineering concepts and practical business decisionsâ€”a skill that directly translates to explaining complex software architectures and technical solutions to non-technical stakeholders.
