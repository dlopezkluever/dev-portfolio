## Project Overview

**Xtraktor** is a revolutionary Windows desktop application that eliminates the tedious task of manually reviewing hours of recorded content by automatically transforming your audio and video files into structured, actionable insights. Struggling to get through long articles or books? Xtraktor's online text "Xtraktion" feature pulls the key thesis and insights out of any book or article you find online so you can learn faster.

## The Problem We Solve

Every day, professionals, students, and lifelong learners consume countless hours of both spoken and written content:
- **📊 Business professionals** attend back-to-back meetings with important decisions buried in hours of discussion
- **🎓 Students** record lectures AND struggle through dense textbooks and academic papers  
- **💼 Consultants and researchers** conduct interviews AND analyze lengthy reports and documentation
- **🚀 Entrepreneurs** participate in investor calls AND need to digest market research and industry reports
- **📚 Lifelong learners** consume podcasts, audiobooks, AND want to extract insights from articles and books

**The traditional solution?** Manually re-listening to recordings, re-reading books, taking scattered notes, and hoping you didn't miss anything critical. This process is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frankly, soul-crushing.
