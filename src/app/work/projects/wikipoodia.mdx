## Project Overview

**Wikipoodia** is a hilarious Chrome extension that transforms Wikipedia into a comedy goldmine by seamlessly injecting AI-generated fake facts into articles for harmless pranking. Built in just 3 hours during the intense Gauntlet AI X AMP Hackathon, this project earned **3rd place** by combining rapid development, AI integration, and pure entertainment value.

## 🏆 Hackathon Achievement

Created under extreme time pressure during the **Gauntlet AI X AMP 3-Hour Hackathon**, Wikipoodia demonstrates the power of rapid prototyping and AI-first development. Despite the tight deadline, the extension delivers a polished user experience with sophisticated AI integration - earning recognition as a top-3 finalist among all competing teams.

## 🎭 Core Functionality

### **AI-Powered Fake Fact Generation**
- **Contextual Intelligence**: AI analyzes Wikipedia article content to generate relevant, believable fake facts
- **Multiple Humor Modes**: Five distinct comedic styles from family-friendly to outrageous
- **Seamless Integration**: Facts blend naturally into existing paragraphs without disrupting formatting
- **Smart Targeting**: Automatically selects optimal injection points within articles

### **🎯 Five Humor Modes**
- **🟢 Goofy Mode**: Family-friendly, whimsical scenarios perfect for workplace pranks
- **🟡 Outrageous Mode**: PG-13 humor with embarrassing and bizarre situations  
- **🔴 Obscene Mode**: Adult humor with explicit content for close friends
- **🔄 Utter Misinformation Mode**: Complete opposite facts that flip reality upside down
- **🖤 Evil Mode**: Dark conspiracies and sinister undertones to innocent activities

### **⚡ Performance & UX Features**
- **Lightning Fast**: 100ms injection for cached facts, 500ms for new AI generations
- **Smart Caching**: 24-hour fact storage prevents duplicates and improves speed
- **Format Preservation**: Maintains all Wikipedia links, citations, and styling
- **Cross-Tab Sync**: Settings work seamlessly across all browser tabs

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
