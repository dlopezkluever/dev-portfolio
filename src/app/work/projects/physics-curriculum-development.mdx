## Overview

At Chicago Bulls College Prep, I taught 6 courses of Honors and Standard Physics, covering content typically found in University Physics 1 & 2 courses. Beyond teaching, I developed a completely new curriculum tailored to optimize student learning outcomes while improving SAT skills.

## Curriculum Innovation

### Course Design
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Developed lessons covering mechanics, thermodynamics, electricity & magnetism, and modern physics
- **SAT Integration**: Incorporated SAT-style problems and critical thinking exercises throughout the curriculum
- **Practical Applications**: Designed engaging labs and projects connecting physics theories to real-life examples

### Educational Technology
- Created interactive demonstrations using programming skills to visualize complex physics concepts
- Developed automated grading systems for homework and quizzes
- Built online resources for students to access supplementary materials

## Teaching Methodology

### Student-Centered Approach
- Implemented differentiated instruction for honors and standard-level students
- Created visual aids and interactive simulations to explain abstract concepts
- Developed project-based assessments that encouraged practical problem-solving

### Results & Impact
- Improved student test scores by implementing targeted review sessions
- Increased student engagement through hands-on experiments and real-world applications
- Received positive feedback from students and administration for innovative teaching methods

## Skills Applied
- Curriculum development and instructional design
- Educational technology integration
- Data analysis for tracking student progress
- Clear communication of complex technical concepts
- Project management and time optimization

## Key Takeaway

This experience strengthened my ability to break down complex technical concepts into understandable componentsâ€”a skill that directly translates to technical documentation, team training, and client communication in software development.
