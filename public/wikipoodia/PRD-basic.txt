# **Product Requirements Document: Wikipoodia Chrome Extension**

## **1\. Introduction**

The Wikipoodia Chrome Extension is an advanced browser extension designed to inject intelligent, contextually-aware, and hilariously absurd "facts" into Wikipedia articles. Its primary purpose is to provide a sophisticated and entertaining pranking experience with customizable humor modes, ranging from family-friendly fun to adult-level crude humor. The extension features AI-powered fact generation that adapts to specific paragraph content, multiple humor intensity levels, and professional Wikipedia-style presentation with authentic hyperlinks, creating an immersive and believable pranking experience.

## **2\. Goals**

* **Core Goal:** To create a highly amusing and surprising experience for unsuspecting Wikipedia readers with maximum impact content saturation.  
* **Advanced Engagement:** To generate unique, paragraph-specific, and contextually hyper-relevant fake facts using generative AI with intelligent content awareness.  
* **Customizable Humor:** To provide three distinct humor modes (Goofy, Outrageous, Obscene, Utter Misinfo / Evil) allowing pranksters to tailor the experience to their audience and comfort level.  
* **Professional Presentation:** To create facts that are indistinguishable from real Wikipedia content through authentic styling, hyperlinks, and seamless integration.  
* **Maximum Coverage:** To inject facts into 50% of article paragraphs (every other paragraph) with up to 50 facts per page for comprehensive pranking impact.  
* **Simplicity:** To provide an intuitive user interface for enabling/disabling the prank and selecting humor modes.  
* **Stealth:** To operate completely invisibly once configured, maintaining the illusion of authentic Wikipedia content.

## **4\. Features**

### **4.1. Enhanced Content Injection System**

* **Maximum Coverage Content Injection:** The extension identifies paragraph elements (`<p>`) within Wikipedia articles and injects facts into 50% of them (every other paragraph) for comprehensive prank coverage.  
* **Strategic Sequential Selection:** Paragraphs are selected from top to bottom of the article (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) ensuring consistent distribution throughout the reading experience.  
* **Intelligent Volume Management:** Pages are capped at 50 facts maximum to prevent performance issues while maintaining high-impact pranking on large articles.  
* **Professional Integration:** Injected facts are seamlessly inserted with Wikipedia-authentic styling, formatting, and hyperlinks to maintain complete believability.

### **4.3. Intelligent AI-Powered Fact Generation**

* **Paragraph-Specific Context Awareness:** AI analyzes individual paragraph content to generate facts that are specifically relevant to the historical events, people, places, and topics mentioned in each targeted paragraph.  
* **Hyper-Contextual Relevance:** Instead of generic page-level facts, each generated fact relates directly to the specific content surrounding its injection point, creating natural narrative flow.  
* **Mode-Adaptive Content Generation:** AI prompts dynamically adjust based on selected humor mode, ensuring generated content matches the appropriate humor intensity and content restrictions.  
* **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** Sophisticated prompt templates incorporate both page-level context (subject, page type) and paragraph-level context (specific events, people, dates) for maximum relevance.  
* **Intelligent Content Analysis:** Extension parses paragraph text to identify key entities, themes, and topics before generating contextually appropriate absurd facts.  
* **Optimized Caching Strategy:** Facts are cached using paragraph-specific and mode-aware keys to reduce API calls while maintaining contextual accuracy.  
* **Robust Error Handling:** Comprehensive error management with fallback strategies for API failures, content policy violations, and rate limiting.

### **4.4. Wikipedia-Style Hyperlink Integration**

* **Automatic Entity Recognition:** Generated facts are parsed to identify real people, places, events, and organizations that correspond to actual Wikipedia pages.  
* **Authentic Link Styling:** Hyperlinks are formatted to match Wikipedia's exact visual style, including colors, underlining, and hover effects.  
* **Real Wikipedia Destinations:** Links only point to genuine Wikipedia pages, maintaining authenticity and allowing users to explore related real content.  
* **Intelligent Link Validation:** System verifies Wikipedia page existence before creating links, skipping fictional or non-existent entities.  
* **Seamless Link Integration:** Multiple links per fact are supported while maintaining natural text flow and professional appearance.  
* **Preserves Wikipedia Functionality:** Linked pages maintain full Wikipedia functionality including further browsing and legitimate content exploration.

### **4.6. Advanced State Persistence**

* **Comprehensive Setting Storage:** Both prank enabled/disabled state and selected humor mode are saved using Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync` API, ensuring all preferences persist across browser sessions and device synchronization.  
* **Mode-Aware Initialization:** When Wikipedia pages load, the content script checks both prank status and humor mode, applying appropriate AI prompting and content generation accordingly.  
* **Cross-Session Continuity:** Users maintain their configuration across browser restarts, device switches, and extension updates without reconfiguration.  
* **Intelligent State Management:** Extension handles state transitions gracefully, immediately applying new settings to current and future page visits.
