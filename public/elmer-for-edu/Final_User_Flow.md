   * **Experience:** Drag-and-drop functionality for uploads; visual rendering of the uploaded or created geometry/mesh with options for simple manipulation. Clear feedback if files are invalid.  
3. **Define Physics (Material Properties & Boundary Conditions):** Users assign material properties (e.g., Young's Modulus, Poisson's Ratio) to different parts of their geometry and apply boundary conditions (e.g., fixed constraints, applied loads).  
   * **Experience:** Intuitive forms with dropdowns for common materials, visual indicators on the geometry for applied boundary conditions. Error validation ensures physically sensible inputs.  
4. **Configure Solver Settings:** Users select the type of simulation (e.g., structural, thermal) and adjust relevant solver parameters.  
   * **Experience:** Simplified options for typical student use cases, with advanced settings optionally available.

#### **3.2.2 Simulation Execution & Monitoring**

\[Configure Solver\] → \[Run Simulation\] → \[Monitor Progress\] → \[Completion Notification\]

**Steps:**

1. **Initiate Simulation:** With all parameters defined, users click "Run Simulation".  
2. **Monitor Progress:** A dedicated simulation monitoring screen displays real-time progress, including solver output, elapsed time, and estimated completion time.  
   * **Experience:** Dynamic progress bars, live log output, and system status indicators. Option to pause or stop a simulation (with confirmation).  
3. **Completion Notification:** Users receive a clear notification upon successful completion or an error message if the simulation fails.  
   * **Experience:** Prominent success message ("Simulation Complete\!"), or detailed error report with suggestions for troubleshooting.

#### **3.2.3 Results Visualization & Analysis**

\[Completion Notification\] → \[View Results\] → \[Analyze & Interpret\]

**Steps:**

1. **Access Results:** After completion, users are automatically directed to the results visualization interface or can navigate to it from the project dashboard.  
2. **Visualize Data:** The platform displays simulation results, including basic 2D and 3D visualizations of scalar fields (e.g., displacement, temperature) and vector fields (e.g., stress).  
   * **Experience:** Interactive 3D viewer (rotate, zoom, pan), color maps for scalar data, arrows for vector data. Options to adjust visualization settings.  
3. **Analyze & Interpret:** Users can inspect specific points, generate simple plots, and compare results across different simulation runs (future feature, but implied for analysis).  
   * **Experience:** Tools for probing values, creating cross-sections, and basic data export for further analysis.

### **3.3 Educational Content & Assessment Flow**

This flow integrates learning directly into the platform.

## **4\. Error Handling & Visual Feedback**

**Principles:**

* **Immediate Feedback:** Users receive instant visual cues for actions (e.g., loading spinners, success checkmarks, error crosses).  
* **Clear Error Messages:** Error messages are specific, actionable, and user-friendly, avoiding technical jargon. They suggest next steps or link to troubleshooting guides.  
* **System Status Indicators:** Prominent indicators show the status of the ElmerFEM container and simulation processes.  
* **Recovery Options:** For critical errors (e.g., Docker container failure), users are presented with clear options to restart or reconfigure.

**Flow:**
