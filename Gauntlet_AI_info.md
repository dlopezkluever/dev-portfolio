What is Gauntlet AI?
Gauntlet AI is an intensive 10-week program designed to develop the next generation of AI-enabled technical leaders. Our program blends unmatched intensity with real-world challenges and rapid learning.

This intensive 10-week program is designed to develop the next generation of AI-enabled technical leaders, preparing graduates for the $200K/year roles with the participating companies.

The Gauntlet Experience
The Gauntlet is, by design, extremely intensive.

It is not for everyone.

It is structured at a level of difficulty that will require the smartest people on the planet to give everything they've got, and to learn at an accelerated pace.

We hope it will be the hardest you've ever worked.

We hope it will be the fastest you've ever learned.

We hope you'll build more than you previously thought possible.

And we think it will be worth it.
