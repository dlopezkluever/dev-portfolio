### **Task: Refactor and Update Portfolio Website**

**Goal:** Implement a new design for the project sections on the homepage and work page, using the "Deep Wiki Guide for styling" as a reference. This involves adding three specific projects, clearing out old content, and creating detailed project pages with a consistent structure.

**Instructions for Coder (Cursor):**

1. **Homepage Project Styling:**  
   * **Carousel:** For each project on the homepage, implement a carousel feature allowing users to cycle through at least two images.  
   * **Project Information:** Display the project name as a title, along with a brief description. This information should be positioned next to the carousel.  
   * **"Learn More" Link:** Below the description, add a "Learn More" link styled with a small arrow icon next to it. This styling should be consistent with the "Deep Wiki Guide" and the original "Read Case Study" element. This link should lead to the detailed project page.  
2. **Content Management:**  
   * **Clear Existing Content:** Delete all current content on both the homepage and the work page.  
   * **Add New Projects:** Add the three specified projects to both the homepage and the work page.  
3. **Detailed Project Pages:**  
   * **Structure and Styling:** Create a dedicated page for each project. These pages should be consistently styled, featuring a title and tags for technologies used.  
   * **Image Gallery:** Underneath the main project description, display all images from the relevant project folder. Arrange these images in a gallery format, with two images per row.  
   * **Project Links:** At the bottom of each project page, include two styled links: "See Project" and "See GitHub." Both links should be accompanied by an arrow icon, similar in style to the "Read Case Study”of old and the “Learn More" of now link.  
4. **Project-Specific Details:**  
   * **Project 1: ElmerFEM for Edu**  
     * **Homepage Carousel Images:** Use FEA results viz.png and FEA mesh results vizp png.  
     * **Detailed Page Images:** Display all images from the Elmer FEM project folder.  
     *  Use @PRD \- ElmerFEM4Edu.md @Final\_User\_Flow.md as context for the "ElmerFEM for Edu" project i built, in the title, and description and page content that is opened when the user presses "Learn More"  
   * **Project 2: Merlin's Grimoire**  
     * **Homepage Carousel Images:** Use picture-01.png and picture-02.png from the Merlin's Grimoire folder.  
     * **Detailed Page Images:** Display all images from the Merlin's Grimoire project folder.  
     * Use @README.md and @master-PRD.md as context for the "Merlin's Grimoire" project i built, in the title, and description and page content  
   * **Project 3: Xtraktor**  
     * **Homepage Carousel Images:** Use picture one and picture two from the Extractor folder.  
     * **Detailed Page Images:** Display all images from the Xtraktor project folder.  
     * Use@user-flow.md  and @[master-PRD.md](http://master-PRD.md) and, specifically @README\_Xtraktor.md   as context for the "Xtraktor" project i built,  for the title, and description and page content  
     * Possible additional context for description:””” Xtraktor, a desktop application that eliminates the tedious task of manually reviewing hours of recorded content by automatically transforming your audio and video files into structured, actionable insights\! Struggling to get through long articles or books? Xtraktor's new online text "Xtraktion" feature is for you\! It pulls the key thesis and insights out of any book or article you find online so you can learn faster. Next on the roadmap: a Review & Quiz page\! “””  
5. **Future Expansion:** Note that more projects will be provided later to be added solely to the work page, underneath these initial three.  
6. Important Notes:  
   * On the work page it uses 4 images in the carousel for each card, rather than just 2, so pic two more photos to display along with the main two that are displayed on the home page for each project, so just add more images in each of the folders for each card on the work page  
   * For creating the content in the page’s for each project, really try to use the styling Made specifically for the pages, should be similar as the the work experience pages for each job i’ve had, but add the pictures under the text content, and links to my github, and the project underneath the images
